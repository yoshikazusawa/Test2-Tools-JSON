=head1 NAME

Test2::Tools::JSON - Compare JSON string as data structure with Test2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::V0;
    use Test2::Tools::JSON;
    
    is {
        foo     => 'bar',
        payload => '{"a":1}',
    }, {
        foo     => 'bar',
        payload => json({a => E}),
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test2::Tools::JSON provides comparison tools for JSON string.
This module was inspired by L<Test::Deep::JSON>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item $check = json($expected)

Verify the value in the C<$got> JSON string has the same data structure as C<$expected>.

    is '{"a":1}', json({a => 1});

    is '{"a":{"b":1},"c":2}', json hash { field a => {b => 1}; etc; };

=item $check = relaxed_json($expected)

Verify the value in the C<$got> relaxed JSON string has the same data structure as C<$expected>.

    is '[1,2,3,]', relaxed_json([1,2,3]);
